# HelloFresh Code Challenge


The solution is built using a docker machine with Jupyter Notebook and Conda installed. 
This is with the purpose of having documentation inside the code and to have a better
understanding of all the stages.

In order to run the code, please follow the instructions listed below:

## Method 1 (If you don't have docker installed or Conda with Jupyter Notebooks)

Install Docker 
```
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

sudo groupadd docker

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

newgrp docker 
```

After the installation you can run the Jupyter Notebook without needing to install Conda in your computer.
First of all you need to build your new Docker image using the SQL/Dockerfile file in this repository:
```
docker build -t hellofresh .

# Verify that the image has been built
docker images

# You should see a list of images with one of them named hellofresh
```

Run the image in a container

```
docker run -it -e GRANT_SUDO=yes --user root -p 8888:8888 --name=challenge hellofresh
```

You will be prompted an output like this:

```

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-14-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://7d843798cc24:8888/?token=e9d155f5dba4937e4c52ee444b8b9874accd8f9f75d9d3cb
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=e9d155f5dba4937e4c52ee444b8b9874accd8f9f75d9d3cb
```
Please open the last link (http://127.0.0.1......) in your browser.

Now you can run the code using a Jupyter Notebook!

## Method 2 (if you have Conda installed on your computer)

Start a Conda environment on your terminal and run:

```
jupyter notebook HelloFresh.ipynb
```

Run the code!
